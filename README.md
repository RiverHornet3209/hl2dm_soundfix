This fix operates on the server side. No additional downloads for the client.
## Description
The February 18 2025 update didn't fix the sounds in the 32-bit version of HL2DM. 
The February 18 2025 update also broke sounds on 32-bit versions of CS:S, DOD:S, HLDM:S and TF2. This fix contains modifed soundscript files.
